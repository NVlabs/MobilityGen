# Parquet Data Format

Below is a description of the fields in a typical MobilityGen recording, common to all scenarios.

| Field | Type | Shape | Description |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| robot.action | array | 2 | The command linear, angular velocity in the robot frame. |
| robot.position | array | 3 | The xyz position of the robot in the world frame. |
| robot.orientation | array | 4 | The quaternion of the robot in the world frame. |
| robot.joint_positions| array | N | The joint positions of the robot. |
| robot.joint_velocities | array | N | The joint velocities of the robot. |
| robot.linear_velocity | array | 3 | The linear velocity of the robot in the world frame. (Retrieved by robot.get_linear_velocity() in isaac sim) |
| robot.angular_velocity | array | 3 | The linear velocity of the robot in the world frame.  (Retrieved by robot.get_angular_velocity() in isaac sim) |
| robot.front_camera.left.segmentation_info | dict |  | The segmentation info dictionary as retrieved by the Isaac Sim replicator annotator. |
| robot.front_camera.left.segmentation_image | array | (HxW) flattened | The segmentation image as retrieved by the Isaac Sim replicator annotator.  Flattened |
| robot.front_camera.left.segmentation_image.shape | tuple | 2 | The segmentation image shape. |
| robot.front_camera.left.rgb_image | bytes |  | The RGB camera image compressed to JPG. |
| robot.front_camera.left.depth_image | array | (HxW) | The depth image (in meters) flattened into an array. |
| robot.front_camera.left.depth_image.shape | tuple | 2 | The shape of the depth image.

> Note, there are additional fields with similar semantics for other cameras we have excluded brevity.

Below are fields specific to the path following scenario

| Field | Type | Shape | Description |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| target_path | array | (Nx2) flattened | The target path generated by the path planner in world coordinates. This is updated whenever the path planner is called, which occurs when the robot reaches a goal (or at the beginning of a new recording) |
| target_path.shape | tuple | 2 | The shape of the target path array. |
